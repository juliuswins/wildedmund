    <p>If you received any vaccines prior to 1999-2001, many contained Thimerosal (an organic mercury compound). Likewise, since 1926, many vaccines also continue to contain Aluminium.</p>

       <p>While the insistence is that Thimerosal is not linked to Autism, it is however highly correlated to Tics and Tic Disorders (such as Tourettes, so it's neurological in nature), as well as a fair link to Attention Deficit Disorder. Also note that Tic disorders are a common trait of / often overlap with Autism.</p> 
        
       <p>Furthermore - there is actually a link between Autism Spectrum Disorder and Early-Onset Dementia, including Alzheimer's! In spite of these facts, some scientific journals that should acknowledge these connections still assert that there is no conclusive correlation between Thimerosal and Autism.</p> 
        
       <p>The abolition of Thimerosal was only complete by 2001, after it was deemed unsafe 'as a precaution' and no direct admission of guilt or danger in 1999. While the roster of vaccinations would have been considerably smaller and is difficult to officially determine, the current Australian roster consists of over 20 vaccinations required by the age of 4. According to my own immunisation record, I had received 10 different doses of vaccines in my first 18 months alive.</p> 

       <p>One will find that 'aluminium is naturally occuring in many foods we eat' - but oddly substantially higher traces in instant formula compared to natural breast milk. The general scientific consensus is that Aluminium is safe to ingest in small amounts, about 2-6mg per day for children and 6-14mg for teens and adults. Some medications use larger doses of Aluminium, for example buffered aspirin with 10-20mg. Antacids contain 100-200mg of Aluminium (out of 300-600mg aluminium hydroxide) which allegedly barely reaches the bloodstream. Trace amounts also appear in drinking water, and in the air as a pollutant. The consensus is that it is safe, okay in food, vaccines, drugs, air, baby formula. And yet on the contrary, it is considered a neurotoxin, with a highly plausible link to Alzheimer's Disease that is "built upon very solid experimental evidence and should not be dismissed." Each year, 10 million new dementia cases emerge globally, according to the World Health Organization.</p>
    
       <p>The COVID vaccine apparently doesn't contain either, in spite of many documents still yet to be disclosed, or largely redacted. It did however contain mRNA technology, which does not contain the live vaccine as some claim - instead, it is a nucleic acid that TEACHES the body to produce the virus spike protein (hence being a 'Messenger' RNA), all from within a protective nanostructure. In other words, no, it's not the live virus, but it teaches your body to produce your own live COVID spike proteins whilst coated in nanotechnology to protect itself and slow your body's natural immune system from attacking the foreign entity (the mRNA vaccine) itself.</p> 
        
       <p>This new mRNA technology is obviously different to proven vaccine technology used in the past, which typically used dead virus cells in order to teach the body resistance against the intended virus or disease without the effects of sickness and risk of facing the real underlying illness. It is misleading to suggest that because vaccines have previously been considered safe, that mRNA technology doing this must be safe too under the umbrella of being a 'vaccine' in spite of the additional danger that should be obvious to anybody reading this.</p> 
        
       <p>It is also misleading to assert that there is no link between Thimerosal and Autism - I found multiple scientifically-proven correlations using multiple scientific journals and I am not even a scientist.</p> 
        
       <p>But hey, maybe I'm crazy. After all, I did get 3 COVID shots. And as somebody who has been diagnosed (by a licensed psychologist) with depression and anxiety in the past, perhaps the vaccine has affected me mentally:</p> 
        
       <p>"Our study confirmed that there is a significant relationship between psychological factors and COVID-19 vaccine side effects in chronological order. Psychosocial factors should be examined when assessing side-effect reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine."</p> 
        
       <p>They say to trust the science, yet it is distorted, cherry-picked and politicized by both government and legacy media. Meanwhile, science quietly admits the faults and even malice of big health in plain sight, while everybody argues over moot points and largely ignore this reality - you are not meant to know about any of these studies or abstracts.</p> 
        
       <p>It seems we've in fact been trading immunity for older, rarified illnesses in exchange for increasingly common and even modernly emerging ones. Best of all is that it is very easy to pinpoint the motivation behind all of this; Healthcare companies that get a vaccine on the schedule result with an indefinite annual commission, government-funded of course and with increasing demand as the population rises.<p>
    
       <p>I haven't even touched upon the suppression and undermining of other existing pharmaceuticals that were required in order for official governments to legally declare a vaccine mandate - "undone science" in the name of agenda. Those who want to read more about this could consider the book 'Bad Pharma' (2012) - which outlines stories of systemic scientific fraud through pharma controlling academic research of its own products. At this point, we'd be more accepted to suggest that nobody could survive due to natural herd immunity before vaccinations existed, than to even cast doubt upon an 'infallible and altruistic' money-making industry.</p> 
        
       <p>I used to think the claims I'm making here were simply a typical conspiracy theory that I would laugh off - and now feel disillusioned, wishing I didn't have to know and believe such travesties were possible. I would also love to hear any health scientist explain any way I may have mistakenly interpreted anything, though I will not accept mere ad hominem attacks as legitimate criticism and discourse. Nor, will I allow the premise that I am overstating what is instead being understated and largely repressed issues both historically and currently, all of which create distrust in vaccine technology (which has long been effective in many circumstances against many illnesses).</p> 
        
       <p>I hope, in spite of whatever scrutiny may come from my sharing this (supposing anybody sees it), that I may help inform some people and implore everyone to look a bit deeper at the real science - as opposed to blind trust or even baseless or misleading conspiracy websites. I also hope that one day healthcare can revert back away from being a financial industry where it therefore benefits certain rich corporate managers and <a href="https://www.latintimes.com/rfk-jr-calls-out-bernie-sanders-taking-money-pharmaceutical-industry-confirmation-hearing-574133">even lobbied politicans' pockets</a> to keep the public sick.</p>
<br>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Julian.</p>
<br>
<p>P.S. I would also recommend that everybody read <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360755683_Who's_afraid_of_The_Real_Anthony_Fauci">this essay by an Australian professor that deconstructs Robert F. Kennedy's book about Fauci and the American Healthcare Industry's historical corruption, which corroborate many of RFK's claims with other books similarly written about the topic.</a> I warn you that it takes a further dive of cynical corruption in healthcare if the claims the book appear to suggest are true.</p>
<p>Also, some more research that show many other bodily problems that can result from high aluminium exposure, particularly in cases of aluminium poisoning, caused by 100 micrograms per litre of blood in the body. The average adult has 4.5-5.5 Litres of blood, but typically aluminium is first filtered by stressing the liver and kidney. Studies showing effects of large aluminium exposures including the brain, kidney, pancreas and metabolism:</p>
