    <p>The following is all obtained and asserted using information from the National Institute of Health. "Trust the science," as they say.</p>

    <p>If you received any vaccines prior to 2002, they all contained Aluminium (from 1932). If you received any prior to 1999, many contained Thimerosal (an organic mercury compound).</p>

       <p>While the insistence is that Thimerosal is not linked to Autism, it is however highly correlated to Tics and Tic Disorders (such as Tourettes, so it's neurological in nature), as well as a fair link to Attention Deficit Disorder. Also note that Tic disorders are a common trait of / often overlap with Autism.</p> 
        
       <p>And as naturally occuring and even abundantly absorbed as the neurotoxin Aluminium is in the modern world, it has a plausible link to Alzheimer's Disease that is "built upon very solid experimental evidence and should not be dismissed."</p> 
        
       <p>Furthermore - there is actually a link between Autism Spectrum Disorder and Early-Onset Dementia, including Alzheimer's! In spite of these facts, some scientific journals that should acknowledge these connections still assert that there is no conclusive correlation between Thimerosal and Autism.</p> 
        
       <p>Thus, any of the 86.15% of 1 year olds in 1999 in Australia would have received vaccines that contained Aluminium. And of course, until the complete abolition of Thimerosal in 2001, it was also commonly (but not always) used in vaccinations. while the roster of vaccinations would have been considerably smaller and is difficult to officially determine, the current roster has over 25 vaccines on the Queensland schedule in Australia between infancy and 5.</p> 
        
       <p>The COVID vaccine apparently doesn't contain either of these - nor do any vaccines since 2001 for Thimerosal and 2002 for Aluminium. It did however contain mRNA technology, which does not contain the live vaccine as some claim - instead, it is a nucleic acid that TEACHES the body to produce the virus spike protein, all from within a protective nanostructure. In other words, no, it's not the live virus, but it teaches your body to produce your own live COVID spike proteins whilst coated in nanotechnology to protect itself and slow your body's natural immune system from attacking the foreign entity (the mRNA vaccine) itself.</p> 
        
       <p>This mRNA technology is obviously different to proven vaccine technology in the past, which was typically the use of dead cells in order to teach the body resistance against the intended virus or disease without the effects of sickness and risk of facing the real underlying illness.</p> 
        
       <p>It is misleading to suggest that because vaccines have previously been considered safe, that mRNA technology doing this must be safe too under the umbrella of being a 'vaccine' in spite of the additional danger that should be obvious to anybody reading this.</p> 
        
       <p>It is also misleading to assert that there is no link between Thimerosal and Autism - I found multiple scientifically-proven correlations using multiple scientific journals and I am not even a scientist.</p> 
        
       <p>But hey, maybe I'm crazy. After all, I did get 3 COVID shots. And as somebody who has been diagnosed (by a licensed psychologist) with depression and anxiety in the past, perhaps the vaccine has affected me mentally:</p> 
        
       <p>"Our study confirmed that there is a significant relationship between psychological factors and COVID-19 vaccine side effects in chronological order. Psychosocial factors should be examined when assessing side-effect reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine."</p> 
        
       <p>They say to trust the science, yet it is distorted, cherry-picked and politicized by both government and legacy media - you are not meant to know about any of these studies or abstracts. Meanwhile, science quietly admits the faults and even malice of big health in plain sight, while everybody argues over moot points and largely ignore this reality.</p> 
        
       <p>It seems we've in fact been trading immunity for older, rarified illnesses in exchange for increasingly common and even modernly emerging ones. Best of all is that it is very easy to pinpoint the motivation behind all of this; Healthcare companies that get a vaccine on the schedule result with an indefinite annual commission, government-funded of course and with increasing demand as the population rises. I haven't even touched upon the suppression and undermining of other existing pharmaceuticals that were required in order for official governments to legally declare a vaccine mandate - "undone science" in the name of agenda. Those who want to read more about this could consider the book 'Bad Pharma' (2012) - which outlines stories of systemic scientific fraud through pharma controlling academic research of its own products.</p> 
        
       <p>I used to think the claims I'm making here were simply a typical conspiracy theory that I would laugh off - and now feel disillusioned, wishing I didn't have to know and believe such travesties were possible. I would also love to hear any health scientist explain any way I may have mistakenly interpreted anything, though I will not accept mere ad hominem attacks as legitimate criticism and discourse.</p> 
        
       <p>I hope, in spite of whatever scrutiny may come from my sharing this (supposing anybody sees it), that I may help inform some people and implore everyone to look a bit deeper at the real science - as opposed to blind trust or even baseless or misleading conspiracy websites.</p>
<br>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Julian.</p>
