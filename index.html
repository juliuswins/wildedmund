<h3>ABOUT:</h3>
<p>Edmund Aubury is a man who is yearning to live in nature. He had already avoided working and paying taxes for years.</p>
<p>He was radical in his opinions and was looking for a way out of a system he didn’t care for.</p>
<p>Now he will go a step further, living entirely off the grid – away from laws, society and estrangement from his own family. He would live in the Australian bushland with only his essentials. He would hunt to survive and explore the wilderness for his entertainment.</p>
<p>What begins as a holiday, soon turns into a nightmare. He must face nature at its most dangerous, humanity at its most cruel and his own past, while at his most vulnerable.
